# Symbola - an icon font for TileMill and Mapnik

This is a font made from public domain SVG's. They deserve all of the credit,
I'm just packaging them into fonts.

- [Maki](https://github.com/mapbox/maki/)
- [AIGA](http://thenounproject.com/collections/aiga/)
- [National Park Service](http://thenounproject.com/collections/national-park-service/)

This font allows you to make dynamic marker symbols in TileMill based on data
attributes. In addition to being able to dynamically select a marker symbol, you can
easily change the colors of the symbols on your map also using the standard `text-fill`
attribute in TileMill.
